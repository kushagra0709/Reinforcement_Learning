# Reinforcement_Learning
Created an ML agent in unity that learns using Reinforcement Learning

The project involves developing a 2D snake game using reinforcement learning and ray tracing. The objective of the project was to train an agent to play the game using a reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates ray tracing, which will enable it to learn and improve its performance through trial and error while also allowing for more accurate collision detection.

The project uses Unity as the game engine and Python API(provided by ML-Agents) for controlling the agent simulation loop of the game.
